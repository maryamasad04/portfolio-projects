    Plastic pollution refers to the accumulation of plastic objects and particles
    (e.g., plastic bottles, bags, and microplastics) in the Earth's environment that
    adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. Plastic pollution,
    accumulation in the environment of synthetic plastic products to the point that
    they create problems for wildlife and their habitats as well as for human
    populations. In 1907 the invention of Bakelite brought about a revolution in
    materials by introducing truly synthetic plastic resins into world commerce.
    By the end of the 20th century, plastics had been found to be persistent polluters
    of many environmental niches, from Mount Everest to the bottom of the sea.
