    Industrial air pollution is when factories, mines, and transportation release
    harmful substances into the air. These pollutants can cause health problems such
    as respiratory diseases, cancers, decreased lung function, and asthma. Industrial
    air pollution is a pressing issue affecting not only the health and well-being of
    individuals but also the environment. In India, industrialization has rapidly
    increased in recent years, leading to rising air pollution levels and deteriorating
    air quality. The problem is particularly acute in developing countries like India,
    where rapid industrialization has led to an increase in the number of factories and
    power plants. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO). </p>
